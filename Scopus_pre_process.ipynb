However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.   \n",
              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.   \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.   \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.   \n",

              "      <td>We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Reversible logic has become very promising for low-power design using emerging computing technologies. A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In this research, a general formula for the Casimir force between ideal metal plate and a dissipative dielectric slab has been obtained. The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Correspondence Address\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8813,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"J.

However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

Resonant absorption by TLSs in the dielectric poses a serious limitation to the performance of superconducting qubits; however, the microscopic nature of these systems has yet to be established. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.  \n",
              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.  \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.  \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.  "

              "      <td>Lattice based cryptography is attractive for its quantum computing resistance and efficient encryption/decryption process. However, the Big Data issue has perplexed most lattice based cryptographic systems since the overall processing is slowed down too much. This paper intends to analyze one of the major lattice-based cryptographic systems, Nth-degree truncated polynomial ring (NTRU), and accelerate its execution with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for acceptable processing speed. Three strategies, including single GPU with zero copy, single GPU with data transfer, and multi-GPU versions are proposed for performance comparison. GPU computing techniques such as stream and zero copy are applied to overlap computations and communications for possible speedup. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GPU acceleration of NTRU. As the number of involved devices increases, better NTRU performance will be achieved. © 2014, Atlantis Press.

              "      <td>Dissipative two-level systems (TLS) have been a long-standing problem in glassy solids over the last fifty years, and have recently gained new relevance as sources of decoherence in quantum computing. Resonant absorption by TLSs in the dielectric poses a serious limitation to the performance of superconducting qubits; however, the microscopic nature of these systems has yet to be established. Based on first-principles calculations, we propose that hydrogen impurities in Al2O3 are the main source of TLS resonant absorption. Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity and can easily incorporate in Al2O3.We find that interstitial H in Al2O3 forms a hydrogen bond (O-H...O). At specific O-O distances, consistent with bond lengths found in amorphous Al2O3 or near Al2O3 surfaces or interfaces, the H atom feels a double well. Tunneling between two symmetric positions gives rise to resonant absorption in the range of 10 GHz, explaining the experimental observations. We also calculate the expected qubit-TLS coupling and find it to lie between 16 and 20 MHz, consistent with experimental measurements.</td>\n",

              "      <td>We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Reversible logic has become very promising for low-power design using emerging computing technologies. A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts. This replacement technique is not very promising, because it leads to high quantum cost and garbage outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing synchronous sequential circuits directly from reversible gates using pseudo Reed-Muller expressions representing the state transition and the output functions of the circuit. We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "2  We present a new complete set of states for a class of open quantum systems, to be used in expansion of the Green's function and the time-evolution operator. A remarkable feature of the complete set is that it observes time-reversal symmetry in the sense that it contains decaying states (resonant states) and growing states (anti-resonant states) parallelly. We can thereby pinpoint the occurrence of the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the choice of whether we solve Schrödinger equation as an initial-condition problem or a terminal-condition problem. Another feature of the complete set is that in the subspace of the central scattering area of the system, it consists of contributions of all states with point spectra but does not contain any background integrals. In computing the time evolution, we can clearly see contribution of which point spectrum produces which time dependence. In the whole infinite state space, the complete set does contain an integral but it is over unperturbed eigenstates of the environmental area of the system and hence can be calculated analytically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the complete set by computing explicitly the survival probability and the escaping probability as well as the dynamics of wave packets. The origin of each term of matrix elements is clear in our formulation, particularly, the exponential decays due to the resonance poles. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.   \n",

A number of good works have been reported on reversible combinational circuit design. However, only a few works reported on the design of reversible latches and flip-flops on the top of reversible combinational gates and suggested that sequential circuits be built by replacing the latches and flip-flops and associated combinational gates of the traditional irreversible designs by their reversible counter parts.

We present designs of arbitrary synchronous sequential circuit as well as practically important sequential circuits such as counters and registers. It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.   \n",

The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.   \n",

It is found that our direct designs save 1.54%-49.09% quantum cost and 51.43%-81.82% garbage outputs than the replacement design approach suggested earlier. © 2014 IEEE.</td>\n",

              "      <td>In this research, a general formula for the Casimir force between ideal metal plate and a dissipative dielectric slab has been obtained. The dielectric function of the slab is assumed to be an arbitrary complex function of frequency satisfying Kramers-Kronig relations. A classical expression for the radiation pressure of the vacuum fields on the slab is presented by using the Maxwell stress tensor. With the transition to the quantum domain and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem and Kubo's formula, the resulting expression is written in terms of the imaginary part of the vector potential Green functions components of the system. Finally, by computing the Green function, the Casimir force on the slab is obtained. This formalism enables us to calculate the Casimir force without resorting to the explicit form of the field operators. The general expression is confirmed by limiting and comparing with one of the previous works. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.</td>\n",

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this paper, we show how computing such subsystem fidelities can be done efficiently in many cases when the two states are represented as tensor networks. Formulated using Uhlmann's theorem, such subsystem fidelities appear as natural quantities to extract for certain subsystems of matrix product states and tree tensor networks, and evaluating them is algorithmically simple and computationally affordable. We demonstrate the usefulness of evaluating subsystem fidelities with three example applications: studying local quenches, comparing critical and noncritical states, and quantifying convergence in tensor network simulations. \\u00a9 2018 American Physical Society.\",\n          \"As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu et al (2002 Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 057904), the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which is robust to the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that the number of required steps grows much more slowly than the system size if the number of non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that small fluctuations of the parameters of optical elements do not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against the certain type of errors as we considered. Last but not least, we present an example of implementation of the simulation on a photonic chip as well as an optimized scheme. By such examples, we show a reduction of the costs compared to its classical counterpart and the potential for further improvement, which promotes a more general application. \\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a hot topic of research. A bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation protocol based on eight-qubit entangled states is proposed. This protocol enables Alice and Bob to transmit two-qubit quantum states to each other under the control of a supervisor. The specific steps and derivation process of the theoretical plan were proposed, and the theory proved the correctness of the plan. To understand the impact of noise in quantum teleportation, the fidelity changes of this scheme were analysed under different types of noise channels. The influencing factors of fidelity were determined, which will provide a basis for optimising the transmission scheme and improving transmission performance in the future. An experimental circuit was built and simulated through the IBM Quantum Experience platform to verify the correctness and feasibility of the theory. The results showed that this solution can successfully reconstruct the sent quantum state with high fidelity. Finally, the security analysis of this scheme was conducted and compared with other traditional related schemes. This scheme has higher efficiency, lower resource consumption, simpler operation, and stronger security. The advantages of the scheme were pointed out. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PredictedCountry\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As the consequences of temporally correlated noise on the performance of quantum algorithms are not well understood, the capability to engineer and inject such noise in quantum systems is paramount. To date, noise injection capabilities have been limited and highly platform specific, requiring low-level access to control hardware. We experimentally validate our method by comparing to a direct hardware-based noise-injection scheme. Using a combination of quantum noise spectroscopy and classical signal analysis, we show that the two approaches agree. These results showcase a highly versatile method for noise injection that can be utilized by theoretical and experimental researchers to verify, evaluate, and improve quantum characterization protocols and quantum algorithms for sensing and computing. \\u00a9 2022 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.\",\n          \"Reticle optimization is a computationally demanding task in optical microlithography for advanced semiconductor fabrication. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of D-Wave's quantum annealing (QA) and hybrid steepest descent (SD) solvers in solving pixelated binary reticle optimization problems. We show that the energy derived from the objective function depends on annealing time and inter-sample correlation. Specifically, longer annealing times and reduced inter-sample correlations result in lower energy. Moreover, introducing efficient pausing strategies in forward annealing could reduce the QA runtime by approximately 100-fold while achieving similar results to long annealing times. Finally, reticles with increased variables lead to widespread irregular values in default sorted QA energies due to quantum chain breakages, which could potentially limit the probability of attaining the optimal solution. A hybrid approach that applies the classical SD algorithm to the QA results increases the probability of locating the global minimum solution and reduces runtime to about one-third compared to the classical SD solver. These findings facilitate our comprehension of quantum computing for accelerating computational lithography in semiconductor manufacturing.  \\u00a9 2013 IEEE.\",\n          \"A major challenge in developing topological superconductors for implementing topological quantum computing is their characterization and control. It has been proposed that a p-wave-gapped topological superconductor can be fabricated with single-atom precision by assembling chains of magnetic atoms on s-wave superconductors with spin\\u2013orbit coupling. Here we analyse Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference in Mn chains, constructed atom by atom on Nb(110), and reveal the formation of multi-orbital Shiba bands using momentum-resolved measurements. We find evidence that one band features a topologically non-trivial p-wave gap, as inferred from its shape and particle\\u2013hole asymmetric intensity. Our work is an important step towards a distinct experimental determination of topological phases in multi-orbital systems by bulk electron band structure properties only. \\u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1584,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['United States', 'Germany', 'Italy']\",\n          \"['Japan', 'Italy', 'United Kingdom']\",\n          \"['Italy', 'Estonia']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
